### How to resize our canvas element?
- Change `width` and `height` using inline style on `canvas` element
`canvas width=# height=#`

### Why do we give canvas an id?
- Like any HTML element, it makes it easier to select it for JS to alter and CSS to style

### Exercise (set timer for 10 minutes): 
1. Create a canvas element in HTML with a width and height of 500 pixels
2. Style the canvas to have 10px pixel wide solid borders that are colored #333
3. Give the canvas an id (optional)
